### Hi there, I'm Preeti ðŸ‘‹

I am Graduate student at University of Texas, studying Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence. I'm shaping my journey in the world of technology, exploring the vast potential of data and its transformative power. My Bachelor's in Management Studies, with a focus on Marketing, taught me the art of storytelling, while analytics now equips me with the tools to quantify and enhance these narratives effectively. From designing impactful dashboards to crafting marketing campaigns, I thrive at the intersection of creativity and data. Only way forward is to transforming insights into measurable results.
